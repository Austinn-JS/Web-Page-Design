			<h2>Why am I interested in Coding?</h2>
			<p>
				Back in eigth grade is the first time dove into coding, that was <strong>JavaScript</strong>, specifically utilizing <strong>Node.js</strong>. It started as simple single file projects and evolved into a multi-file project. I learned how to optimize my code, figured out how to debug it, and now I continue to evolve and maintain my own project. I began branching off into implementing other things, such as attempting to use a SQL Database with my project, I even began using MongoDB which
				is a cloud data platform. My project continues to evolve in many ways. To think, it all began as a tiny one file project and evolved.

			<h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
			<p>Listed below are some of my hobbies and interests outside of <i>school</i>:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Coding:</strong> One of my favorite things to do, mostly because it can be challenging is coding. One thing I do not like is math, my mom always laughs at that. I like coding, but absolutely despise math.</li>
				<li><strong>Gaming:</strong> Gaming is a fun one, games are great time wasters. Help pass the time, and a lot are just really enjoyable. Especially games like <i>Red Dead Redemption II</i>.</li>
				<li><strong>Friends & Family:</strong> Spending time with my Friends and Family is a good one as well, I love driving around with my friends and just having fun around <strong>Maize</strong>. I used to not care about driving, now I am so happy that I can go <i>anywhere</i> I want on my own.</li>

			<h2>Future Goals</h2>
			<p>My dream is to become a web application developer. Creating websites, or even Node.js applications. To me, it doesn't seem feasible, you can dream all you want, the challenge is achieving such a dream. If I can't afford to chase that dream, I would also like to become a Nuclear Engineer in the <strong>U.S. Navy</strong>. Free education and I'd get to serve my country.</p>
