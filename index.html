			<h1>10 Year Plan</h1>
			<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ultimately haven't decided what I plan to, I may go into the Armed Forces, possibly the Marines or Navy. Likely serving for a while, hopefully long enough to get benefits to leave with. Such as a free Secondary
				Education, and health care. It will ultimately rely on how long I choose to serve within the Armed Forces, as they aren't the easiest/most enjoyable positions, but I feel as though for everything this country has done for me, I should put
				effort back into it by serving for it. Upon exiting, I hope to pursue a job in Nuclear Engineering as it pays well, and is interesting to me. In reality, I'd be fine with most Engineering Positions, as I enjoy seeing how things operate, as
				well as designing new things. I'm not creative, I tend to focus on functionality over looks, so Engineering sounds like a great field for me.

		<div id="college">
			<h1>College Choice</h1>
			<p>
				I hope to get my education covered for serving in the Military, hopefully in Nuclear Engineering, although that could change. It all depends on what I can make it in to, I would enjoy going to the Naval Academy, but their acceptance rate is
				low at 8.5%, Westpoint is aswell, with only a 11.5%, so I will likely just use the G.I. bill for a standard college. A basic college education is all I need, I don't plan to go to college unless I get it for cheap or free via the G.I. Bill,
				as I find it as too big of a risk to dump money into, in hopes that what I go in for doesn't become obsolete in my lifetime. As it currently appears that there is more and more pressure for renewable sources like Solar and Wind, which I fear
				will put Nuclear Power on the back burner and the unpreferred method.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="career">
			<h1>Career Choice</h1>
			<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I've repeatedly said above, I would like a job in the Engineering Field, whether it be Nuclear Engineering or something else. I just like the process of desiging, creating, and seeing my designs/thoughts come to
				life. Although, I wouldn't mind pursuing coding. Infact, I also still include coding as an oppurtunity I might take. Although I only know more of a Serverside Code, I'd like to learn more front end, maybe even some React.js.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="Life Beyond">
			<h1>Life</h1>
			<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to stay in Kansas, as it seems the most liveable place, because money seems to go further than in most other cities. Hopefully I could afford to get a nice house, in a well maintained neighborhood. As well
				as a new truck (although I hope to keep my 2000 Silverado, to turn into a project truck). Theoretically I'd like to find someone I can trust and enjoy the rest of my life with, but most marriages don't last and are costly when it comes to
				splitting assets. So, it would be nice to get married and have children, but at the moment I lack the trust in anyone to do so.
