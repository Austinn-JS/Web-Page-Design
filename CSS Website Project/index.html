				I hope to join the Navy once I graduate highschool, and I plan to serve for about 5 years (possibly going through their Nuclear Engineering Program), if I do that I will have to serve a full five years for it to be free. Upon exiting I hope
				to find a job with that education, as I can make a liveable amount of money off of it.

				I will likely go through the <strong><a href="https://www.usna.edu/MechEngDept/degrees/Nuclear%20Engineering.php#fndtn-panel3Outcomes">Naval Academy</a></strong> for the Nuclear Engineering, and as I stated above, I hope to exit with that
				education and no debt, to a well paying job that I hope to enjoy.

			<p>
				I would like to stay in Kansas, as it seems the most liveable place, because money seems to go further than in most other cities. Hopefully I could afford to get a nice house, in a well maintained neighborhood. As well as a new truck
				(although I hope to keep my 2000 Silverado, to turn into a project truck). Theoretically I'd like to find someone I can trust and enjoy the rest of my life with, but most marriages don't last and are costly when it comes to splitting assets.
				So, it would be nice to get married and have children, but at the moment I lack the trust in anyone to do so.
