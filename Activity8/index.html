    <h1>Google Apps</h1>
    <p class="pagedesc">Google originally started as a search engine website. It now has grown into one of the most innovative companies in history!</p>
    <hr/>
<h2>My Favorite Google Apps</h2>
<p>Google has been adding apps to their website <strong>constantly</strong>. Listed below are some of my favorite:</p>
    <p><strong>Google Drive: </strong><i>is a personal cloud storage service that lets users store and synchronize digital content across computers.</i></p>
<p><strong>Google Slides: </strong><i>it lets you collaborate with co-workers creating slides in real time.</i></p>
<p><strong>Google Sites: </strong><i>is a structured wiki- and Web page-creation tool that anyone create simple web sites.</i></p>
